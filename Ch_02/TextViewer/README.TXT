=======================================================================

This directory contains the source code to the MFC library.

These files have been included for reference purposes, in
conjunction with the Class Library Reference manual and tutorial.

These files are compiled to form the Microsoft Foundation Classes 4.2
(MFC 4.2).  The library may be built in a number of configurations,
character sets (UNICODE or ANSI), and whether or not debugging and
diagnostic aids are to be included in applications which link with
the library.
